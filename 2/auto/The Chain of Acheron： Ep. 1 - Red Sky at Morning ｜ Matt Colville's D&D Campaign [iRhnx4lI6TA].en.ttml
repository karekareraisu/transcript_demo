<p begin="00:02:00.740" end="00:02:06.049" style="s2">crazy dream where we get to play a D&amp;D</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.299" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">live and some people watch and who knows</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.049" end="00:02:10.340" style="s2">what&#39;ll happen the thing you missed is</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:12.739" style="s2">that I promised everybody that you would</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.340" end="00:02:13.790" style="s2">get to see us make characters live on</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.739" end="00:02:15.110" style="s2">the stream cuz I thought that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.790" end="00:02:16.610" style="s2">lot of fun but then I changed my mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.110" end="00:02:18.440" style="s2">because I thought that would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.610" end="00:02:20.180" style="s2">incredibly tedious and boring and it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.440" end="00:02:22.340" style="s2">be 45 minutes of people saying wait what</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.180" end="00:02:23.989" style="s2">is this a proficiency bonus and which I</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.340" end="00:02:27.019" style="s2">which skill is the one I want to take</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.989" end="00:02:28.970" style="s2">and that&#39;s not interactive and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.019" end="00:02:30.620" style="s2">fun to watch so what we did was we all</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.970" end="00:02:32.780" style="s2">everybody came and made characters and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.620" end="00:02:34.700" style="s2">they rolled dice and they generate their</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.780" end="00:02:36.200" style="s2">stats but they all did it separately so</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.700" end="00:02:37.850" style="s2">the players do not know this would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.200" end="00:02:39.410" style="s2">the first time many of the players have</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.850" end="00:02:42.500" style="s2">seen the other characters they&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.410" end="00:02:44.990" style="s2">and we filmed the die rolling part and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.500" end="00:02:46.550" style="s2">we made a video</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.990" end="00:02:47.720" style="s2">that we&#39;re all gonna watch now so not</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.550" end="00:02:49.880" style="s2">only are you gonna get to meet the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.720" end="00:02:56.600" style="s2">heroes of this campaign for the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.880" end="00:02:58.310" style="s2">time so are the players okay so now can</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.600" end="00:03:01.220" style="s2">we tell who that is just buy the dice</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.310" end="00:03:04.310" style="s2">they&#39;re using wooden toys you can&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.220" end="00:03:08.690" style="s2">I think as long as yes I think so</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.310" end="00:03:10.880" style="s2">so twelve thirteen nine so far I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.690" end="00:03:14.270" style="s2">this is this is a sign of things to come</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.880" end="00:03:16.460" style="s2">this is Captain average a professor a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.270" end="00:03:19.670" style="s2">solution doctor average 15 I think is as</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.460" end="00:03:21.020" style="s2">good as it gets for this dude too low so</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.670" end="00:03:23.080" style="s2">I had up my own little house rule which</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.020" end="00:03:25.940" style="s2">is you get to re-roll the stat if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.080" end="00:03:28.190" style="s2">below eight I think for eight or lower</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.940" end="00:03:29.450" style="s2">and then if your total bonuses didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.190" end="00:03:31.790" style="s2">equal plus two or more if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.450" end="00:03:34.430" style="s2">player bonuses if it wasn&#39;t plus two or</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.790" end="00:03:36.010" style="s2">more than you get to reroll and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.430" end="00:03:38.240" style="s2">think anybody had to reroll actually a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.010" end="00:03:43.640" style="s2">couple of people got the eight or lower</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.240" end="00:03:47.170" style="s2">problem so this is a human fifth level</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.640" end="00:03:49.100" style="s2">everybody starts a fifth level fighter</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.170" end="00:03:58.880" style="s2">battle master which is as close to a</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.929" end="00:17:39.960" style="s2">next session things are gonna open up</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.460" end="00:17:51.690" style="s2">you guys get a lot more freedom in</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.960" end="00:17:55.940" style="s2">choice so one of these cameras is up I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.690" end="00:17:55.940" style="s2">think that&#39;s the one that people can see</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.770" end="00:18:12.630" style="s2">blues light painting painted this is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.820" end="00:18:15.539" style="s2">Pegasus minis model yeah he did an</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.630" end="00:18:18.630" style="s2">amazing job with like the torches the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.539" end="00:18:21.570" style="s2">torches illuminating the walls and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.630" end="00:18:23.340" style="s2">stained glass is pretty cool yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.570" end="00:18:24.510" style="s2">need to have a light behind there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.340" end="00:18:25.169" style="s2">if there was a light in here yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.510" end="00:18:26.429" style="s2">would be awesome</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.169" end="00:18:27.419" style="s2">I have no idea there&#39;s no top to this</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.429" end="00:18:31.169" style="s2">but it looks like there&#39;s a place to put</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.419" end="00:18:34.500" style="s2">tops weird all three of these working I</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.169" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">think only the middle is the middle one</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.500" end="00:18:37.919" style="s2">is the one that people can watch on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:39.870" style="s2">mainstream I forgot to tell anybody that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.919" end="00:18:43.200" style="s2">we have two streams we literally have</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.870" end="00:18:45.179" style="s2">two streams one is the one you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.200" end="00:18:49.530" style="s2">watching right now MGM the other one is</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.179" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">/ MC d m2 and I think we need to switch</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.530" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">back to the yeah the other ones MC BM -</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:55.980" style="s2">and that&#39;s the stream that is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:18:58.140" style="s2">overhead camera and all the tactile</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.980" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">cameras and that way if you are</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.140" end="00:19:02.070" style="s2">obviously if you&#39;re on mobile it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:03.539" style="s2">gonna be great but if you&#39;re on your</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.070" end="00:19:05.370" style="s2">computer at home you can be switching</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.539" end="00:19:07.559" style="s2">back and forth and minimize or maximize</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.370" end="00:19:10.559" style="s2">any window launched and get yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.559" end="00:19:12.510" style="s2">could use simultaneous aim time but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.559" end="00:19:14.370" style="s2">idea is that it&#39;s very limited our</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.510" end="00:19:15.960" style="s2">ability to show you what&#39;s happening on</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.370" end="00:19:18.150" style="s2">the table I tend to run a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.960" end="00:19:21.000" style="s2">tactical game so the second stream is</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.150" end="00:19:21.990" style="s2">literally anis I think it&#39;s like 15</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.000" end="00:19:24.690" style="s2">frames a second or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.990" end="00:19:27.539" style="s2">so it&#39;s super low bandwidth this is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.690" end="00:19:28.440" style="s2">Cathedral of Saint Clement the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.539" end="00:19:33.720" style="s2">journeyman</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.440" end="00:19:38.270" style="s2">and it is the largest building in Black</p>

<p begin="00:22:35.710" end="00:22:41.260" style="s2">when the bells toll he&#39;s in there being</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.660" end="00:22:43.120" style="s2">a priest in this temple they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.260" end="00:22:45.309" style="s2">to switch them over to you worship Ajax</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.120" end="00:22:53.860" style="s2">if he&#39;s the saint and that also happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.309" end="00:22:56.020" style="s2">in last campaign so we gotta figure out</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.860" end="00:22:58.350" style="s2">what we&#39;re gonna do he&#39;s gonna be in</p>

<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:10.780" style="s2">guards at the church my suggestion was</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.650" end="00:23:11.800" style="s2">that we you know pose as city guards I</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.780" end="00:23:13.059" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna work for you</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.800" end="00:23:14.850" style="s2">because you&#39;re a goblin probably not</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.059" end="00:23:17.980" style="s2">thinking tells your</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.850" end="00:23:19.690" style="s2">so your name in man you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.980" end="00:23:22.659" style="s2">sniping anyway most likely with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.690" end="00:23:24.100" style="s2">arrows so I don&#39;t know I assume this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.659" end="00:23:25.510" style="s2">a building right yeah those are</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.100" end="00:23:27.220" style="s2">buildings yeah yeah you can and those</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.510" end="00:23:31.600" style="s2">are alleys the black bottom is</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.220" end="00:23:34.510" style="s2">notoriously with twisty windy narrow</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.600" end="00:23:37.780" style="s2">streets and the volcanoes are buildings</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.510" end="00:23:39.490" style="s2">yeah the wards are the wards on him</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.780" end="00:23:41.080" style="s2">the boards are on him so he&#39;s guarded by</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.490" end="00:23:42.909" style="s2">you know don&#39;t you have a ton of like</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.080" end="00:23:44.380" style="s2">model building something yeah but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.909" end="00:23:45.909" style="s2">don&#39;t wanna block everything so uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.380" end="00:23:49.539" style="s2">well we&#39;ll use that we&#39;ll use that in</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.909" end="00:23:50.440" style="s2">other scenarios well like if I put a mic</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.539" end="00:23:52.059" style="s2">here you wouldn&#39;t be able to see what</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.440" end="00:23:53.650" style="s2">the hell&#39;s going on that&#39;s right so Ivan</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.059" end="00:23:55.659" style="s2">had a lot of time to figure out tactics</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.650" end="00:23:58.090" style="s2">for this obviously got it and here we</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.659" end="00:23:59.590" style="s2">are so the only thing I got is that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.090" end="00:24:01.240" style="s2">come in as city guards so people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.590" end="00:24:03.549" style="s2">gonna think much of us probably Phil and</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.240" end="00:24:05.590" style="s2">I since we&#39;re melee fighter type people</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.549" end="00:24:07.390" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get up near them we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.590" end="00:24:09.429" style="s2">attack him I don&#39;t think until you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.390" end="00:24:11.470" style="s2">land a hit so that&#39;s where we can maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.429" end="00:24:14.110" style="s2">use your lieutenant ability to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.470" end="00:24:15.400" style="s2">tom has the highest initiative I would</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.110" end="00:24:17.169" style="s2">think that we might get some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.400" end="00:24:17.740" style="s2">surprise but who knows if he knows what</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.169" end="00:24:19.659" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.740" end="00:24:21.400" style="s2">yeah this is us kind of figuring it out</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.659" end="00:24:23.230" style="s2">what are these buildings look like they</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.400" end="00:24:26.140" style="s2">slanted roof flat-topped</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.230" end="00:24:28.030" style="s2">they&#39;re slanted roof yeah okay yeah are</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.140" end="00:24:30.850" style="s2">there any upper storey windows looking</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.030" end="00:24:33.400" style="s2">out onto the street uh yeah there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.850" end="00:24:35.559" style="s2">yeah all these buildings have these like</p>

<p begin="00:27:49.600" end="00:27:53.170" style="s2">insubordinate yeah so it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.310" end="00:27:55.720" style="s2">commander&#39;s the top he tells us</p>

<p begin="00:38:55.240" end="00:39:11.110" style="s2">you&#39;re not trying to squeeze through</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:34.150" style="s2">you see you see you&#39;re looking you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.570" end="00:39:36.520" style="s2">looking outgoing is a good place to set</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.150" end="00:39:38.860" style="s2">up copper coming up here and yeah copper</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.520" end="00:39:41.590" style="s2">is literally riding this thing is head</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.860" end="00:39:43.270" style="s2">is scraping the ceiling and he&#39;s writing</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.590" end="00:39:48.460" style="s2">on the cat pretty low the cat sees you</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.270" end="00:39:53.890" style="s2">and the cat just kind of flops down so</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.460" end="00:39:58.510" style="s2">what do we what do we didn&#39;t get to you</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.890" end="00:39:59.920" style="s2">ask questions I asked but now what do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.510" end="00:40:01.740" style="s2">know about the boards other than that</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.920" end="00:40:05.410" style="s2">the arrows are supposed to get thrown</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.740" end="00:40:07.480" style="s2">you know that like the chronicle talks</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.410" end="00:40:09.940" style="s2">about powerful wizards being able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.480" end="00:40:12.940" style="s2">ward themselves and that the wards</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.940" end="00:40:14.350" style="s2">happen automatically even if the wizard</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.940" end="00:40:16.480" style="s2">isn&#39;t aware what&#39;s going on and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.350" end="00:40:18.040" style="s2">defensive but they can also do things</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.480" end="00:40:21.190" style="s2">like warts can do things like summon</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.040" end="00:40:23.350" style="s2">creatures so the there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.190" end="00:40:24.820" style="s2">cactus to deal with but they&#39;re all and</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.350" end="00:40:26.950" style="s2">they all they typically involve a higher</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.820" end="00:40:28.730" style="s2">level party like a lot of the encounters</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.950" end="00:40:30.650" style="s2">the crop the chain have dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.730" end="00:40:32.450" style="s2">past thousand years that deal with</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.650" end="00:40:35.030" style="s2">wizards that hi you&#39;re typically higher</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.450" end="00:40:36.589" style="s2">level and you can do things like you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.030" end="00:40:38.810" style="s2">counter their words so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.589" end="00:40:40.670" style="s2">actually it sort of assumes that whoever</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.810" end="00:40:43.000" style="s2">is reading this is high enough level to</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.670" end="00:40:47.420" style="s2">understand how high-level Wizards work</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.000" end="00:40:49.190" style="s2">but the idea is they&#39;re defensive but</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.420" end="00:40:51.020" style="s2">they can do things like summon creatures</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.190" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">or whatever and they go off</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.020" end="00:40:54.410" style="s2">automatically the person doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:56.150" style="s2">have to be aware is happening do we know</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.410" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">what this was Ernest traveling Ollie by</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.150" end="00:41:03.200" style="s2">the party and if so how many because</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.760" end="00:41:05.000" style="s2">you&#39;re the one to talk to ladies area I</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.200" end="00:41:06.950" style="s2">did not talk to latest Ariel you talk to</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.000" end="00:41:09.109" style="s2">ladies Harry off-screen I talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.950" end="00:41:11.480" style="s2">guys what was the question I was</p>

<p begin="01:07:21.430" end="01:07:23.190" style="s2">the fact that this is the start of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.450" end="01:07:24.930" style="s2">campaign</p>

<p begin="01:09:54.790" end="01:09:58.239" style="s2">until eventually he realized he is</p>

<p begin="01:24:31.940" end="01:24:38.580" style="s2">depends on what that something else is</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.120" end="01:24:39.930" style="s2">probably okay I just want like in a</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.580" end="01:24:41.430" style="s2">single turn I&#39;m very multiple spells</p>

<p begin="01:31:54.650" end="01:31:57.800" style="s2">is you can convert your movement into</p>

<p begin="01:31:57.800" end="01:32:00.980" style="s2">opportunity so if you need to get out</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.690" end="01:32:03.440" style="s2">and you need to run past somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.980" end="01:32:04.520" style="s2">might otherwise be able to black you you</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.440" end="01:32:08.719" style="s2">need to use your action to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.520" end="01:32:10.219" style="s2">that does that make sense so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.719" end="01:32:11.780" style="s2">just happened to Hannah what just happen</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.219" end="01:32:13.969" style="s2">Ana was she wanted to grunt past</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.780" end="01:32:15.350" style="s2">Mandrake and but she was like well he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.969" end="01:32:18.409" style="s2">gonna get an attack of opportunity on me</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.350" end="01:32:21.050" style="s2">because I can&#39;t run past him without and</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.409" end="01:32:23.840" style="s2">ignore him right and in order to run</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.050" end="01:32:25.310" style="s2">past him and the defensive buzzer do it</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.840" end="01:32:26.840" style="s2">takes her action and she&#39;d already use</p>

<p begin="01:32:26.840" end="01:32:32.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s the trade-off is you can try</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.520" end="01:32:34.440" style="s2">something but then if it fails whether</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.640" end="01:32:35.820" style="s2">it succeeds or fails if you want to move</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.440" end="01:32:38.280" style="s2">past any of these people they might get</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.820" end="01:32:44.100" style="s2">a free attack on you gotcha this is</p>

<p begin="01:59:34.340" end="01:59:59.830" style="s2">turns into a lightning bolt and then I</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.199" end="02:00:03.700" style="s2">think it falls to that then he</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.830" end="02:00:10.270" style="s2">I really hope I get us booking area I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="02:03:55.250" end="02:04:14.370" style="s2">so you can make an acrobatics check or</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.600" end="02:04:15.600" style="s2">enough actually I think that would be an</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.370" end="02:04:17.550" style="s2">action and you just took your action</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.600" end="02:04:18.900" style="s2">quick oh no I did second one that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:04:20.219" end="02:04:27.960" style="s2">action yeah but I&#39;m a little five eight</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.600" end="02:04:31.320" style="s2">two attacks dos attacks por favor</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.960" end="02:04:36.239" style="s2">so I can at least uh I can at least make</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.320" end="02:04:37.170" style="s2">way down yeah that&#39;s interesting you can</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.239" end="02:04:38.489" style="s2">still make it you can still make a</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.170" end="02:04:39.840" style="s2">regular attack with a javelin because it</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.489" end="02:04:41.670" style="s2">can do its damage in addition to the</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.840" end="02:04:43.530" style="s2">lightning damage that&#39;s right because</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.670" end="02:04:52.620" style="s2">whenever I used to using your rope</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.530" end="02:04:55.770" style="s2">javelin damage and the easy it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.620" end="02:04:59.040" style="s2">Christmas thing it&#39;s as big as a house</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.770" end="02:05:00.679" style="s2">so you roll 4d or way number of javelins</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.040" end="02:05:16.550" style="s2">damages roll twice</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.679" end="02:05:16.550" style="s2">your strength once 26 so it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.360" end="02:05:23.940" style="s2">virus</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.810" end="02:05:26.310" style="s2">oh you don&#39;t get to re-roll it it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.940" end="02:05:28.350" style="s2">that instead of one it&#39;s just - yeah</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.310" end="02:05:29.820" style="s2">that&#39;s what I create this no no a critic</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.350" end="02:05:32.310" style="s2">written is just you roll the weapon down</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.820" end="02:05:33.690" style="s2">you roll your damage again okay are the</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.310" end="02:05:35.639" style="s2">damages you roll it again I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.690" end="02:05:37.949" style="s2">javelin is just visits judge so</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.639" end="02:05:39.989" style="s2">critically javelin is just 36 and you</p>

<p begin="02:45:22.580" end="02:45:26.631" style="s2">[ __ ] I literally only got to play</p>

<p begin="02:45:26.631" end="02:45:29.660" style="s2">not gonna roll new stats okay well I</p>
<p begin="02:45:28.280" end="02:45:32.301" style="s2">don&#39;t know I don&#39;t regret your stats are</p>
<p begin="02:45:29.660" end="02:45:33.740" style="s2">so if you want to roll and thereby maybe</p>
<p begin="02:45:32.301" end="02:45:34.700" style="s2">get better stats you can do that but</p>
<p begin="02:45:33.740" end="02:45:36.351" style="s2">then you start with what you get or if</p>
<p begin="02:45:34.700" end="02:45:38.061" style="s2">you want to keep what you rolled because</p>
<p begin="02:45:36.351" end="02:45:40.280" style="s2">your character adds actually life</p>
<p begin="02:45:38.061" end="02:45:42.351" style="s2">expectancy as it turned out of about two</p>
<p begin="02:45:40.280" end="02:45:43.370" style="s2">rounds then go ahead and do that and he</p>
<p begin="02:45:42.351" end="02:45:46.730" style="s2">said he was thinking about playing</p>
<p begin="02:45:43.370" end="02:45:50.660" style="s2">actually has a okay my retainer he has a</p>
<p begin="02:45:46.730" end="02:45:51.650" style="s2">retainer these are in order to Simba</p>
<p begin="02:45:50.660" end="02:45:53.091" style="s2">I think somebody already know this an</p>
<p begin="02:45:51.650" end="02:45:55.580" style="s2">order to simulate the idea that the</p>
<p begin="02:45:53.091" end="02:45:57.200" style="s2">chain is a mercenary company and these</p>
<p begin="02:45:55.580" end="02:45:58.431" style="s2">are just the senior officers and there</p>
<p begin="02:45:57.200" end="02:46:01.461" style="s2">are junior officers and then a whole</p>
<p begin="02:45:58.431" end="02:46:03.200" style="s2">bunch of people soldiers and we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="02:46:01.461" end="02:46:06.171" style="s2">the retainer rules from strongholds and</p>
<p begin="02:46:03.200" end="02:46:07.820" style="s2">followers so King is one of the</p>
<p begin="02:46:06.171" end="02:46:09.320" style="s2">retainers and I didn&#39;t think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:46:07.820" end="02:46:11.271" style="s2">necessarily needed to be a direct</p>
<p begin="02:46:09.320" end="02:46:12.860" style="s2">correlation between the player creating</p>
<p begin="02:46:11.271" end="02:46:14.900" style="s2">the retainers and then running it these</p>
<p begin="02:46:12.860" end="02:46:17.091" style="s2">are just the junior officers in the</p>
<p begin="02:46:14.900" end="02:46:19.370" style="s2">chain but king is the one retainer that</p>
<p begin="02:46:17.091" end="02:46:20.450" style="s2">Lars made King is an exorcist and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:46:19.370" end="02:46:22.610" style="s2">where we left this you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="02:46:20.450" end="02:46:24.620" style="s2">kind of cleric Kings gonna turn into but</p>
<p begin="02:46:22.610" end="02:46:29.240" style="s2">if you want to you can run and we will</p>
<p begin="02:46:24.620" end="02:46:32.360" style="s2">just assume that King is a king as a</p>
<p begin="02:46:29.240" end="02:46:33.830" style="s2">fifth level cleric of some sort but</p>
<p begin="02:46:32.360" end="02:46:35.030" style="s2">there could be combat coming up in which</p>
<p begin="02:46:33.830" end="02:46:37.160" style="s2">case we&#39;re not actually gonna know what</p>
<p begin="02:46:35.030" end="02:46:42.471" style="s2">his stats are and a third level retainer</p>
<p begin="02:46:37.160" end="02:46:44.150" style="s2">will not survive that combat okay gonna</p>
<p begin="02:46:42.471" end="02:46:46.940" style="s2">play okay so King is gonna stick around</p>
<p begin="02:46:44.150" end="02:46:48.381" style="s2">with the other retainers who are some of</p>
<p begin="02:46:46.940" end="02:46:52.790" style="s2">the junior officers of the chain are all</p>
<p begin="02:46:48.381" end="02:46:53.900" style="s2">looking to the new commander and the</p>
<p begin="02:46:52.790" end="02:46:55.551" style="s2">commander he said we got to get the [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="02:46:53.900" end="02:46:59.381" style="s2">out of Dodge but how does the commander</p>
<p begin="02:46:55.551" end="02:47:02.690" style="s2">express that all right so all right so</p>
<p begin="02:46:59.381" end="02:47:05.931" style="s2">black bottom is a port city correct and</p>
<p begin="02:47:02.690" end="02:47:08.540" style="s2">they&#39;re destroying black bottom yes</p>
<p begin="02:47:05.931" end="02:47:10.040" style="s2">like the whole city I sparked me you</p>
<p begin="02:47:08.540" end="02:47:11.931" style="s2">can&#39;t see the whole city but like but</p>
<p begin="02:47:10.040" end="02:47:14.760" style="s2">you can see the hawk Lords are flying</p>
<p begin="02:47:11.931" end="02:47:19.439" style="s2">around kind of doing their thing yeah</p>
<p begin="02:47:14.760" end="02:47:23.999" style="s2">yeah okay where what direction what</p>
<p begin="02:47:19.439" end="02:47:26.399" style="s2">direction is that&#39;s see here but their</p>
<p begin="02:47:23.999" end="02:47:31.640" style="s2">erection is the harbour that way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:47:26.399" end="02:47:40.310" style="s2">not all right and who is closest</p>
<p begin="02:47:31.640" end="02:47:43.229" style="s2">it&#39;s this way all right so at this point</p>
<p begin="02:47:40.310" end="02:47:47.489" style="s2">yeah go ahead if you like because the</p>
<p begin="02:47:43.229" end="02:47:51.659" style="s2">realm is not particularly interested in</p>
<p begin="02:47:47.489" end="02:47:53.880" style="s2">which people he attacks or yes and Ajax</p>
<p begin="02:47:51.659" end="02:47:56.039" style="s2">is gloating over the death of a serial</p>
<p begin="02:47:53.880" end="02:47:58.109" style="s2">so at this point if you guys want to</p>

<p begin="02:48:25.140" end="02:48:29.069" style="s2">infantry maybe one of those units would</p>
<p begin="02:48:26.760" end="02:48:30.270" style="s2">be special like sappers or Scouts or</p>
<p begin="02:48:29.069" end="02:48:31.739" style="s2">something like that these guys are</p>
<p begin="02:48:30.270" end="02:48:34.020" style="s2">taking heavy morale hits right now</p>

<p begin="02:49:23.909" end="02:49:26.489" style="s2">soldiers they actually call themselves</p>
<p begin="02:49:25.170" end="02:49:26.940" style="s2">that look like only recently they</p>
<p begin="02:49:26.489" end="02:49:28.680" style="s2">started</p>
<p begin="02:49:26.940" end="02:49:30.271" style="s2">this probably won&#39;t last much longer but</p>
<p begin="02:49:28.680" end="02:49:31.440" style="s2">they call themself days because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:49:30.271" end="02:49:33.601" style="s2">about how many days around the year they</p>

<p begin="02:53:26.060" end="02:53:30.020" style="s2">mm-hm because there are demons running</p>
<p begin="02:53:28.040" end="02:53:31.250" style="s2">through the streets and those of you who</p>
<p begin="02:53:30.020" end="02:53:33.800" style="s2">have fought demons before these aren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="02:53:37.880" end="02:53:41.239" style="s2">they&#39;re being ripped apart right getting</p>
<p begin="02:53:39.949" end="02:53:41.960" style="s2">from you here to the docks there&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="02:53:41.239" end="02:53:43.399" style="s2">be a skill challenge</p>
<p begin="02:53:41.960" end="02:53:44.779" style="s2">alright so skill challenge does</p>
<p begin="02:53:43.399" end="02:53:47.479" style="s2">something 4th edition that I quite like</p>
<p begin="02:53:44.779" end="02:53:51.350" style="s2">and what we do is you guys use your</p>
<p begin="02:53:47.479" end="02:53:51.950" style="s2">skills to describe to me how your</p>
<p begin="02:53:51.350" end="02:53:54.170" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="02:53:51.950" end="02:53:57.229" style="s2">can make it easier to get to the docks</p>
<p begin="02:53:54.170" end="02:53:59.750" style="s2">without getting in a fight right and you</p>
<p begin="02:53:57.229" end="02:54:02.630" style="s2">can only each this is cool</p>
<p begin="02:53:59.750" end="02:54:05.390" style="s2">so you have to get six successes before</p>
<p begin="02:54:02.630" end="02:54:07.580" style="s2">you get three failures you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="02:54:05.390" end="02:54:10.729" style="s2">get to the docks right that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="02:54:07.580" end="02:54:12.380" style="s2">issue the question is how what what</p>
<p begin="02:54:10.729" end="02:54:14.150" style="s2">happens once you get there is there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:54:12.380" end="02:54:16.070" style="s2">are a ton of demons there because it</p>
<p begin="02:54:14.150" end="02:54:17.630" style="s2">took you guys too long to get there or</p>
<p begin="02:54:16.070" end="02:54:20.540" style="s2">did you guys get there ahead of this</p>
<p begin="02:54:17.630" end="02:54:21.560" style="s2">wave of chaos that&#39;s rippling through</p>
<p begin="02:54:20.540" end="02:54:23.570" style="s2">the city so you&#39;re gonna get there no</p>
<p begin="02:54:21.560" end="02:54:25.010" style="s2">matter what skills you use you have to</p>
<p begin="02:54:23.570" end="02:54:27.710" style="s2">be trained in the skill you have to be</p>
<p begin="02:54:25.010" end="02:54:31.010" style="s2">proficient in the skill and each person</p>
<p begin="02:54:27.710" end="02:54:33.470" style="s2">can only try each skill right what beach</p>
<p begin="02:54:31.010" end="02:54:35.120" style="s2">skill once right so if you tried I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:54:33.470" end="02:54:37.250" style="s2">give you a couple examples like if</p>
<p begin="02:54:35.120" end="02:54:39.800" style="s2">somebody wanted to use there are gates</p>
<p begin="02:54:37.250" end="02:54:41.330" style="s2">throughout the city and the city guard</p>
<p begin="02:54:39.800" end="02:54:43.460" style="s2">are closing the gates trying to stop</p>
<p begin="02:54:41.330" end="02:54:45.950" style="s2">stem the tide and stop the demons from</p>
<p begin="02:54:43.460" end="02:54:48.320" style="s2">getting from one quarter of the city to</p>
<p begin="02:54:45.950" end="02:54:51.380" style="s2">another you could for instance use your</p>
<p begin="02:54:48.320" end="02:54:53.689" style="s2">athletics to try to bend bars and lift</p>
<p begin="02:54:51.380" end="02:54:54.950" style="s2">gates and open one of these gates and</p>
<p begin="02:54:53.689" end="02:54:57.680" style="s2">that would if you made it that would be</p>
<p begin="02:54:54.950" end="02:55:00.170" style="s2">a success but if you fail then you waste</p>
<p begin="02:54:57.680" end="02:55:01.370" style="s2">time with this thing this it turns out</p>
<p begin="02:55:00.170" end="02:55:02.990" style="s2">to be too heavy and you accumulated</p>
<p begin="02:55:01.370" end="02:55:05.570" style="s2">failure so it&#39;s always a risk reward</p>
<p begin="02:55:02.990" end="02:55:07.070" style="s2">scenario but you got your soonerlater</p>
<p begin="02:55:05.570" end="02:55:08.120" style="s2">you got to get six successes the only</p>
<p begin="02:55:07.070" end="02:55:11.090" style="s2">question is can you do without getting</p>
<p begin="02:55:08.120" end="02:55:16.270" style="s2">any failures and in fact in fact I know</p>
<p begin="02:55:11.090" end="02:55:19.130" style="s2">if it&#39;s gonna work but chat is going to</p>
<p begin="02:55:16.270" end="02:55:21.620" style="s2">take the role of the citizens of Black</p>
<p begin="02:55:19.130" end="02:55:23.479" style="s2">Bottom and they are gonna have some</p>
<p begin="02:55:21.620" end="02:55:25.850" style="s2">effect over your successes or failures</p>
<p begin="02:55:23.479" end="02:55:27.590" style="s2">because it&#39;s up to them to decide how</p>
<p begin="02:55:25.850" end="02:55:29.150" style="s2">did the citizens of Black Bottom react</p>
<p begin="02:55:27.590" end="02:55:32.030" style="s2">to what&#39;s happening there should be a</p>
<p begin="02:55:29.150" end="02:55:35.630" style="s2">straw poll I know that Jerry is super</p>

<p begin="02:58:13.260" end="02:58:17.170" style="s2">there are lots of different ways to use</p>
<p begin="02:58:15.790" end="02:58:18.730" style="s2">skills I have written down but it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="02:58:17.170" end="02:58:21.370" style="s2">to you guys to kind of give me some</p>
<p begin="02:58:18.730" end="02:58:23.440" style="s2">examples like it gave you that one you</p>

<p begin="02:58:25.690" end="02:58:28.930" style="s2">this but there was a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="02:58:26.980" end="02:58:30.851" style="s2">scenarios like you could use perception</p>
<p begin="02:58:28.930" end="02:58:32.860" style="s2">to notice an empty building that you</p>
<p begin="02:58:30.851" end="02:58:34.090" style="s2">could cut so it&#39;s up to you guys to you</p>
<p begin="02:58:32.860" end="02:58:37.330" style="s2">this is your opportunity to use your</p>
<p begin="02:58:34.090" end="02:58:43.180" style="s2">skills creatively how could you use the</p>
<p begin="02:58:37.330" end="02:58:45.311" style="s2">things you&#39;re proficient at to use</p>
<p begin="02:58:43.180" end="02:58:48.010" style="s2">players each player can only use each</p>
<p begin="02:58:45.311" end="02:58:51.400" style="s2">skill once but like let&#39;s imagine you</p>
<p begin="02:58:48.010" end="02:58:53.140" style="s2">all have athletics right you could all</p>
<p begin="02:58:51.400" end="02:58:59.230" style="s2">you could each individually trying to</p>
<p begin="02:58:53.140" end="02:59:00.700" style="s2">break through these gates intimidation</p>
<p begin="02:58:59.230" end="02:59:02.740" style="s2">is yeah that would be great yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:59:00.700" end="02:59:03.910" style="s2">definitely guards that are trying to</p>
<p begin="02:59:02.740" end="02:59:05.710" style="s2">stop people from moving through the city</p>
<p begin="02:59:03.910" end="02:59:07.720" style="s2">and you could make an Intimidator and</p>
<p begin="02:59:05.710" end="02:59:08.590" style="s2">the thing is if you make it the guards</p>
<p begin="02:59:07.720" end="02:59:10.601" style="s2">are gonna help you try to get through</p>
<p begin="02:59:08.590" end="02:59:12.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a success if you fail the guards</p>
<p begin="02:59:10.601" end="02:59:14.021" style="s2">try to stop you and now you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="02:59:12.190" end="02:59:15.521" style="s2">you&#39;re not get this not be a combat you</p>
<p begin="02:59:14.021" end="02:59:17.351" style="s2">could prolly dispatch a city card pretty</p>
<p begin="02:59:15.521" end="02:59:21.101" style="s2">easily special love you guys but that</p>
<p begin="02:59:17.351" end="02:59:22.150" style="s2">takes time that&#39;s a failure is there any</p>
<p begin="02:59:21.101" end="02:59:24.460" style="s2">so intimidation</p>
<p begin="02:59:22.150" end="02:59:27.580" style="s2">we&#39;re totally worth is there any so I</p>
<p begin="02:59:24.460" end="02:59:29.650" style="s2">can move through non-magical terrain I</p>
<p begin="02:59:27.580" end="02:59:30.940" style="s2">can move through difficult train gonna</p>
<p begin="02:59:29.650" end="02:59:32.260" style="s2">affect me some alone you can move</p>
<p begin="02:59:30.940" end="02:59:34.450" style="s2">through it stealthily abnormal pace or</p>
<p begin="02:59:32.260" end="02:59:36.940" style="s2">did slow me I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="02:59:34.450" end="02:59:38.710" style="s2">situations where well this isn&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="02:59:36.940" end="02:59:39.970" style="s2">isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t this is just regular</p>
<p begin="02:59:38.710" end="02:59:41.590" style="s2">but a trip oh I didn&#39;t know if like</p>
<p begin="02:59:39.970" end="02:59:43.900" style="s2">that&#39;s joint buildings would would have</p>
<p begin="02:59:41.590" end="02:59:48.460" style="s2">been like doing something you could</p>
<p begin="02:59:43.900" end="02:59:50.830" style="s2">combine that with like an investigation</p>
<p begin="02:59:48.460" end="02:59:53.410" style="s2">check to see can I find a building yeah</p>
<p begin="02:59:50.830" end="02:59:54.790" style="s2">that is ruined that these guys wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:59:53.410" end="02:59:57.130" style="s2">be able to get by but if they follow me</p>
<p begin="02:59:54.790" end="02:59:58.390" style="s2">if they follow me they can get through</p>
<p begin="02:59:57.130" end="03:00:00.220" style="s2">but that would require you making an</p>
<p begin="02:59:58.390" end="03:00:02.380" style="s2">investigation check to see do I notice</p>
<p begin="03:00:00.220" end="03:00:03.700" style="s2">can I determine that there is terrain</p>
<p begin="03:00:02.380" end="03:00:05.351" style="s2">like that so that you could then use</p>
<p begin="03:00:03.700" end="03:00:08.470" style="s2">your special ability to lead the rest of</p>
<p begin="03:00:05.351" end="03:00:11.490" style="s2">the group and you know there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="03:11:34.850" end="03:11:38.450" style="s2">we played for like two and a half hours</p>
<p begin="03:11:36.470" end="03:11:40.340" style="s2">before the break so we&#39;re getting okay</p>
<p begin="03:11:38.450" end="03:11:43.760" style="s2">you guys as you emerged from the sewers</p>
<p begin="03:11:40.340" end="03:11:45.530" style="s2">you can see the masts of ships right but</p>
<p begin="03:11:43.760" end="03:11:46.729" style="s2">it&#39;s still quite a ways away many</p>
<p begin="03:11:45.530" end="03:11:49.340" style="s2">buildings so you&#39;re definitely going in</p>
<p begin="03:11:46.729" end="03:11:51.190" style="s2">the right direction and that&#39;s when you</p>
<p begin="03:11:49.340" end="03:11:54.550" style="s2">see the band of demon</p>
<p begin="03:11:51.190" end="03:11:57.851" style="s2">and that&#39;s when nails casts distraction</p>
<p begin="03:11:54.550" end="03:12:01.960" style="s2">the demons all book it and I believe</p>
<p begin="03:11:57.851" end="03:12:08.771" style="s2">that&#39;s your six success correct that was</p>
<p begin="03:12:01.960" end="03:12:11.200" style="s2">yes by the way that is a I believe that</p>
<p begin="03:12:08.771" end="03:12:12.460" style="s2">is an easy skill challenge like a hard</p>
<p begin="03:12:11.200" end="03:12:14.710" style="s2">skill challenge will be something like</p>
<p begin="03:12:12.460" end="03:12:15.970" style="s2">it&#39;s always three failures ends it but a</p>
<p begin="03:12:14.710" end="03:12:21.010" style="s2">hard skill challenge will be you need</p>
<p begin="03:12:15.970" end="03:12:22.630" style="s2">twelve successes but given the</p>
<p begin="03:12:21.010" end="03:12:25.000" style="s2">circumstance been wonders increase the d</p>
<p begin="03:12:22.630" end="03:12:25.870" style="s2">c-- know the d c-- depends on the skill</p>
<p begin="03:12:25.000" end="03:12:27.820" style="s2">you&#39;re using in what you&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="03:12:25.870" end="03:12:29.950" style="s2">each skill you&#39;re trying to use is a</p>
<p begin="03:12:27.820" end="03:12:31.870" style="s2">scenario has a different DC so there</p>
<p begin="03:12:29.950" end="03:12:33.460" style="s2">might be so for instance like if you can</p>
<p begin="03:12:31.870" end="03:12:35.021" style="s2">come up with the way to use Arkana in</p>
<p begin="03:12:33.460" end="03:12:37.870" style="s2">this it probably would have been weird</p>
<p begin="03:12:35.021" end="03:12:40.210" style="s2">and obscure and not super relevant to</p>
<p begin="03:12:37.870" end="03:12:41.950" style="s2">escaping a city so it so it so if it</p>
<p begin="03:12:40.210" end="03:12:43.900" style="s2">were allowed that would be a very high</p>
<p begin="03:12:41.950" end="03:12:45.610" style="s2">DC right but a lot of stuff you guys did</p>
<p begin="03:12:43.900" end="03:12:48.870" style="s2">was really straightforward and escaping</p>
<p begin="03:12:45.610" end="03:12:52.510" style="s2">the city in a scenario like this however</p>
<p begin="03:12:48.870" end="03:13:01.920" style="s2">it would not have been easy for you guys</p>
<p begin="03:12:52.510" end="03:13:41.650" style="s2">to so yeah you guys make it to the docks</p>
<p begin="03:13:01.920" end="03:13:44.891" style="s2">you guys are here yeah go mini cannon we</p>
<p begin="03:13:41.650" end="03:13:46.271" style="s2">got all that art for your dude what a</p>
<p begin="03:13:44.891" end="03:13:47.950" style="s2">waste of money that&#39;s right i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="03:13:46.271" end="03:13:56.080" style="s2">invade another D&amp;D campaign to bring it</p>
<p begin="03:13:47.950" end="03:14:00.570" style="s2">back one of the little tripods that</p>
<p begin="03:13:56.080" end="03:14:00.570" style="s2">holds all the curtains whoa</p>
<p begin="03:14:01.370" end="03:14:05.540" style="s2">should we move our guys out of the way</p>
<p begin="03:14:06.771" end="03:14:24.780" style="s2">hello how I spent my weekend sweet what</p>
<p begin="03:14:17.960" end="03:14:26.851" style="s2">we&#39;re saying it&#39;s sweet know me sweet</p>
<p begin="03:14:24.780" end="03:14:28.891" style="s2">now I&#39;m gonna have to I think I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="03:14:26.851" end="03:14:32.690" style="s2">have to name a new commander no tenant</p>
<p begin="03:14:28.891" end="03:14:32.690" style="s2">that&#39;s true that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="03:14:32.990" end="03:14:43.141" style="s2">King I&#39;ll have a new character I&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="03:14:35.040" end="03:14:46.221" style="s2">them does that does not move actually</p>
<p begin="03:14:43.141" end="03:14:53.811" style="s2">none of the parts really move although</p>
<p begin="03:14:46.221" end="03:14:53.811" style="s2">you can pick it up and it does it does</p>
<p begin="03:14:55.311" end="03:14:59.641" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s just sticky kind of took</p>
<p begin="03:14:59.190" end="03:15:01.980" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="03:14:59.641" end="03:15:04.051" style="s2">yeah the layers are really interesting</p>
<p begin="03:15:01.980" end="03:15:05.370" style="s2">that&#39;s the main reason that so you can</p>
<p begin="03:15:04.051" end="03:15:06.601" style="s2">simply get up different fights under</p>
<p begin="03:15:05.370" end="03:15:10.920" style="s2">yeah you can have a running battle that</p>
<p begin="03:15:06.601" end="03:15:14.250" style="s2">went from yeah this was actually this is</p>
<p begin="03:15:10.920" end="03:15:17.221" style="s2">um dark ops is the name of the company</p>
<p begin="03:15:14.250" end="03:15:18.511" style="s2">and this is the sea wolf I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:15:17.221" end="03:15:21.511" style="s2">remember how much this was but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:15:18.511" end="03:15:23.341" style="s2">pretty cool and apart from the masts</p>
<p begin="03:15:21.511" end="03:15:25.051" style="s2">which ship are very tricky and actually</p>
<p begin="03:15:23.341" end="03:15:26.101" style="s2">some of these are not glued in some of</p>
<p begin="03:15:25.051" end="03:15:29.610" style="s2">these would just come off if you took</p>
<p begin="03:15:26.101" end="03:15:32.370" style="s2">them off the it was really easy put</p>
<p begin="03:15:29.610" end="03:15:33.690" style="s2">together it took like five hours to do</p>
<p begin="03:15:32.370" end="03:15:34.950" style="s2">everything but the masts and then</p>
<p begin="03:15:33.690" end="03:15:37.170" style="s2">probably another three or four hours to</p>
<p begin="03:15:34.950" end="03:15:38.221" style="s2">do the masts only because like I said it</p>
<p begin="03:15:37.170" end="03:15:39.960" style="s2">was really tricky and the problem the</p>
<p begin="03:15:38.221" end="03:15:42.721" style="s2">number one problem is the dowels the</p>
<p begin="03:15:39.960" end="03:15:44.670" style="s2">dowels like all of these parts dark</p>
<p begin="03:15:42.721" end="03:15:46.261" style="s2">Ottomans and they come on a thing you</p>
<p begin="03:15:44.670" end="03:15:48.780" style="s2">punch them out and they are machined</p>
<p begin="03:15:46.261" end="03:15:50.641" style="s2">very precisely but the dowels they just</p>
<p begin="03:15:48.780" end="03:15:52.170" style="s2">ordered and so they come it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="03:15:50.641" end="03:15:54.360" style="s2">this one&#39;s nine millimeters thick but</p>
<p begin="03:15:52.170" end="03:15:55.980" style="s2">actually it&#39;s twelve right and I I spent</p>
<p begin="03:15:54.360" end="03:16:00.530" style="s2">most of my time as animal to test to</p>
<p begin="03:15:55.980" end="03:16:02.790" style="s2">sanding these things anyway Andy right</p>
<p begin="03:16:00.530" end="03:16:05.990" style="s2">bla bla gonna tell them about your</p>
<p begin="03:16:02.790" end="03:16:05.990" style="s2">special made name</p>

<p begin="03:37:03.631" end="03:37:11.341" style="s2">this or like this character represented</p>
<p begin="03:37:08.391" end="03:37:13.051" style="s2">as Morton was described to you and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:37:11.341" end="03:37:15.980" style="s2">super far away and kind of floating</p>
<p begin="03:37:13.051" end="03:37:19.381" style="s2">around and from him spells are meeting</p>
<p begin="03:37:15.980" end="03:37:23.190" style="s2">yeah and one of the galleons as is</p>

<p begin="03:37:28.501" end="03:37:33.541" style="s2">listing and sinking and he&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="03:37:31.471" end="03:37:36.030" style="s2">got some kind of crazy extended range on</p>
<p begin="03:37:33.541" end="03:37:38.251" style="s2">his spells they allow them to stay how</p>
<p begin="03:37:36.030" end="03:37:40.650" style="s2">far away is he you can&#39;t get it sent it</p>
<p begin="03:37:38.251" end="03:37:42.830" style="s2">could be a thousand feet so not within</p>
<p begin="03:37:40.650" end="03:37:45.570" style="s2">armor aurait not within weapons range</p>
<p begin="03:37:42.830" end="03:37:47.430" style="s2">320</p>
<p begin="03:37:45.570" end="03:37:49.500" style="s2">actually you would probably recognize</p>
<p begin="03:37:47.430" end="03:37:50.940" style="s2">that this is like battle magic this is</p>
<p begin="03:37:49.500" end="03:37:53.730" style="s2">magic that you only have access to when</p>

<p begin="03:37:58.410" end="03:38:05.760" style="s2">decimates units right the entire crew is</p>
<p begin="03:38:02.970" end="03:38:08.160" style="s2">now very heavily motivated to make sure</p>
<p begin="03:38:05.760" end="03:38:11.130" style="s2">that the sails are properly rigged and</p>
<p begin="03:38:08.160" end="03:38:13.010" style="s2">the Rosco&#39;s yellow is in spite of being</p>
<p begin="03:38:11.130" end="03:38:16.380" style="s2">the biggest ship in poor it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:38:13.010" end="03:38:18.720" style="s2">somehow built for speed and so it is</p>
<p begin="03:38:16.380" end="03:38:21.720" style="s2">accelerating and there was at least one</p>
<p begin="03:38:18.720" end="03:38:24.570" style="s2">other ship a pirate ship well I mean</p>
<p begin="03:38:21.720" end="03:38:26.070" style="s2">like a merchant merchant ship for godot</p>

<p begin="03:38:36.840" end="03:38:42.420" style="s2">say piracy is in the eye of the beholder</p>
<p begin="03:38:39.240" end="03:38:44.340" style="s2">my mother always said so there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="03:38:42.420" end="03:38:46.380" style="s2">other galleon that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="03:38:44.340" end="03:38:49.440" style="s2">keeping pace with the Ross OClO</p>
<p begin="03:38:46.380" end="03:38:51.360" style="s2">and captain massing ham is at the mast</p>
<p begin="03:38:49.440" end="03:38:54.600" style="s2">and she&#39;s barking orders to the crew and</p>
<p begin="03:38:51.360" end="03:38:58.440" style="s2">the entire crew all move as one person</p>
<p begin="03:38:54.600" end="03:39:00.060" style="s2">and Gaston is up here trying to kind of</p>
<p begin="03:38:58.440" end="03:39:03.960" style="s2">coordinate the efforts of the riggers</p>
<p begin="03:39:00.060" end="03:39:08.250" style="s2">and as you guys the wind fills the sails</p>
<p begin="03:39:03.960" end="03:39:10.110" style="s2">and the sky above you it&#39;s now like 7:30</p>

<p begin="03:42:48.439" end="03:42:53.449" style="s2">can kind of talk about what happened and</p>
<p begin="03:42:50.560" end="03:42:56.060" style="s2">part of that is that was a Ryan the</p>
<p begin="03:42:53.449" end="03:42:58.639" style="s2">Master Sword and it makes you basically</p>
<p begin="03:42:56.060" end="03:43:00.859" style="s2">invulnerable to all weapons and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:42:58.639" end="03:43:02.600" style="s2">gone now yeah and what what what the</p>
<p begin="03:43:00.859" end="03:43:04.159" style="s2">power is of the teeth of the Dragon when</p>
<p begin="03:43:02.600" end="03:43:07.069" style="s2">the Master Sword is broken is unknown</p>
<p begin="03:43:04.159" end="03:43:09.439" style="s2">but they were pretty sure that the</p>
<p begin="03:43:07.069" end="03:43:20.119" style="s2">second short sword she pulled out was</p>
<p begin="03:43:09.439" end="03:43:21.799" style="s2">scorpius&#39;s Eliza also so something you</p>
<p begin="03:43:20.119" end="03:43:24.020" style="s2">have to decide and we should do it</p>
<p begin="03:43:21.799" end="03:43:25.909" style="s2">either right now or we should wait and</p>
<p begin="03:43:24.020" end="03:43:28.069" style="s2">talk about it next time we stream so the</p>
<p begin="03:43:25.909" end="03:43:30.109" style="s2">folks don&#39;t miss anything is who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="03:43:28.069" end="03:43:31.669" style="s2">lieutenant I mean yes it could be Lars</p>
<p begin="03:43:30.109" end="03:43:33.049" style="s2">is character that&#39;s up to you because</p>
<p begin="03:43:31.669" end="03:43:35.899" style="s2">they already have ranks and you can only</p>
<p begin="03:43:33.049" end="03:43:37.249" style="s2">have one but but somebody could give up</p>
<p begin="03:43:35.899" end="03:43:39.020" style="s2">their rank and become lieutenant but</p>
<p begin="03:43:37.249" end="03:43:40.579" style="s2">then that means so the relationship</p>
<p begin="03:43:39.020" end="03:43:43.189" style="s2">between the commander and lieutenant is</p>
<p begin="03:43:40.579" end="03:43:44.810" style="s2">the commander decides what jobs do we</p>
<p begin="03:43:43.189" end="03:43:46.579" style="s2">take you don&#39;t you don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="03:43:44.810" end="03:43:47.959" style="s2">really issue orders and that would be</p>
<p begin="03:43:46.579" end="03:43:49.850" style="s2">bad leadership to be constantly telling</p>
<p begin="03:43:47.959" end="03:43:52.039" style="s2">her what to do the lieutenant figures</p>
<p begin="03:43:49.850" end="03:43:54.409" style="s2">out okay how are we gonna do this mm-hm</p>
<p begin="03:43:52.039" end="03:43:56.749" style="s2">right neither one of them really is the</p>
<p begin="03:43:54.409" end="03:43:58.310" style="s2">tactics commander that would be like the</p>
<p begin="03:43:56.749" end="03:44:00.139" style="s2">sergeant if there was one of nobodies</p>
<p begin="03:43:58.310" end="03:44:01.669" style="s2">like that so you guys are still free to</p>
<p begin="03:44:00.139" end="03:44:03.529" style="s2">play your characters in combat whoever</p>
<p begin="03:44:01.669" end="03:44:06.499" style="s2">you want but that&#39;s lieutenant&#39;s job to</p>
<p begin="03:44:03.529" end="03:44:07.939" style="s2">kind of like coordinate the effort after</p>
<p begin="03:44:06.499" end="03:44:09.759" style="s2">the captain decides what we&#39;re doing so</p>
<p begin="03:44:07.939" end="03:44:11.659" style="s2">that&#39;s something you can think about</p>
<p begin="03:44:09.759" end="03:44:13.159" style="s2">Lars I assume you&#39;ll have a new</p>
<p begin="03:44:11.659" end="03:44:16.720" style="s2">character you work here you have nothing</p>
<p begin="03:44:13.159" end="03:44:23.390" style="s2">else to do but make a new person</p>
<p begin="03:44:16.720" end="03:44:25.700" style="s2">keep saying VARs PTO key departs I think</p>
<p begin="03:44:23.390" end="03:44:27.890" style="s2">that&#39;s it I think we&#39;re done I think</p>
<p begin="03:44:25.700" end="03:44:30.440" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna sign off thanks for watching</p>
<p begin="03:44:27.890" end="03:44:31.580" style="s2">as I suspect this is the largest crowd</p>
<p begin="03:44:30.440" end="03:44:34.720" style="s2">we&#39;re ever going to stream to I think</p>
<p begin="03:44:31.580" end="03:44:37.490" style="s2">probably a lot of East Coast folks have</p>
<p begin="03:44:34.720" end="03:44:40.190" style="s2">probably already logged off will upload</p>
<p begin="03:44:37.490" end="03:44:41.930" style="s2">the video to YouTube as soon as we can</p>
<p begin="03:44:40.190" end="03:44:44.030" style="s2">that probably means Friday morning and</p>
<p begin="03:44:41.930" end="03:44:45.980" style="s2">then we&#39;ll do probably a campaign diary</p>
<p begin="03:44:44.030" end="03:44:47.351" style="s2">tomorrow and I&#39;ll talk about what</p>
<p begin="03:44:45.980" end="03:44:49.190" style="s2">happened and we&#39;ll do a live stream</p>
<p begin="03:44:47.351" end="03:44:51.050" style="s2">world-building live stream eleven</p>
<p begin="03:44:49.190" end="03:44:52.730" style="s2">o&#39;clock on Saturday and we might talk</p>
<p begin="03:44:51.050" end="03:44:55.610" style="s2">about this but the one thing that I want</p>
<p begin="03:44:52.730" end="03:44:57.170" style="s2">to wait to talk about is the death of</p>
<p begin="03:44:55.610" end="03:44:58.910" style="s2">the captain because that&#39;s gonna require</p>
<p begin="03:44:57.170" end="03:45:01.250" style="s2">me talking to lawyer&#39;s office offline</p>
<p begin="03:44:58.910" end="03:45:02.240" style="s2">and so when we do the post-mortem on</p>
<p begin="03:45:01.250" end="03:45:03.980" style="s2">this I&#39;m going to declare that</p>
<p begin="03:45:02.240" end="03:45:06.650" style="s2">off-limits for now but not later later</p>
<p begin="03:45:03.980" end="03:45:10.430" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about it otherwise thanks for</p>
<p begin="03:45:06.650" end="03:45:12.521" style="s2">watching everybody see you next</p>
<p begin="03:45:10.430" end="03:45:12.521" style="s2">Wednesday</p>
